## About Nexa

Nexa is a user-friendly, intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) designed to bring the power of local AI inference directly to your desktop. Built to seamlessly integrate with [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), Nexa allows you to effortlessly interact with various large language models (LLMs) running entirely on your local machine, ensuring privacy, speed, and control over your AI interactions.

Say goodbye to cloud-based dependencies and hello to a truly personalized AI experience. Nexa provides a streamlined way to manage and interact with your downloaded Ollama models, making advanced AI accessible to everyone.

## Features

  * **Intuitive GUI:** A clean and easy-to-navigate interface for managing and interacting with AI models.
  * **Ollama Integration:** Seamlessly connects with your local Ollama instance for model inference.
  * **Local Inference:** All AI processing happens on your machine, ensuring data privacy and no internet dependency for inference.
  * **Model Management:** (Potentially) Easily view, download, and remove models directly within the GUI.
  * **Multi-Model Support:** Interact with different LLMs loaded via Ollama.
  * **Customizable Prompts:** (Potentially) Save and reuse your favorite prompts.
  * **Chat History:** (Potentially) Keep track of your conversations with different models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can run Nexa, you need to have Ollama installed and some models downloaded.

  * **Ollama:** Download and install Ollama from their official website: [https://ollama.com/](https://ollama.com/)
  * **Downloaded Models:** After installing Ollama, make sure you've pulled at least one model. You can do this via your terminal (e.g., `ollama pull llama2`) or through Ollama's own GUI if they provide one.

## Using Nexa

(This section will need to be filled out with specific instructions once your GUI is more developed. Here's a placeholder.)

1.  **Ensure Ollama is Running:** Nexa requires your Ollama server to be active. You can usually verify this by checking your system's tray icons or by running `ollama serve` in your terminal if it's not starting automatically.
2.  **Select a Model:** Upon launching Nexa, you should see a list of available models that Ollama has downloaded. Select the model you wish to interact with from the dropdown or model selection area.
3.  **Enter Your Prompt:** Type your query or prompt into the designated input box.
4.  **Generate Response:** Click the "Generate" or "Send" button to send your prompt to the selected local AI model.
5.  **View Response:** The model's response will appear in the output or chat window.
6.  **Continue the Conversation:** You can continue interacting with the model in a conversational manner.

## Supported Models

Nexa supports any model that can be run through Ollama. This includes, but is not limited to:

  * Llama 2
  * Mistral
  * Code Llama
  * Vicuna
  * Dolphin Phi
  * ...and many more\!

For a full list of models compatible with Ollama, please refer to the [Ollama Library](https://ollama.com/library).
